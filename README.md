* This repository contains my first project, which includes three tasks: Password Checker, Backup Script, and CPU Usage Monitor.

* For better organization and clarity, each task is placed in a separate branch with its own README file, allowing the code to speak for itself.

* Additionally, a dedicated folder holds screenshots demonstrating that the scripts function correctly.
